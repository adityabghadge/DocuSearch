Deterministic chunking means the chunking algorithm is purely a function of the input text and configuration.
Given the same input text, chunk_size_chars, and overlap_chars, it always produces the same ordered list of chunks.

Each chunk stores:
- chunk_index
- text
- char_start / char_end offsets
- token_count estimate

Determinism matters because we want reproducible indexing across Docker rebuilds.
